	abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a “common currency” for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and “design principles” for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatio-temporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves “species ordination” of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a “common currency” approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

A Bayesian criterion based on maximizing utility functions is used. Simulated studies are presented and highlight the strong influence of preferential sampling in the decisions. The computational complexity is faced by treating the new local sampling locations as a model parameter and the optimal choice is then made by analysing its posterior distribution. Finally, an application is presented using rainfall data collected during spring in Rio de Janeiro. The results showed that the optimal design is substantially changed under preferential sampling effects. Furthermore, it was possible to identify other interesting aspects related to preferential sampling effects in estimation and prediction in Geostatistics.},

	abstract = {Aim Spatial analysis of the distribution and density of species is of continuing interest within theoretical and applied ecology. Species distribution models (SDMs) are being increasingly used to analyse count, presence–absence and presence-only data sets. There is a growing literature on dynamic SDMs (which incorporate temporal variation in species distribution), joint SDMs (which simultaneously analyse the correlated distribution of multiple species) and geostatistical models (which account for similarity between nearby sites caused by unobserved covariates). However, no previous study has combined all three attributes within a single framework. Innovation We develop spatial dynamic factor analysis for use as a ‘joint, dynamic SDM’ (JDSDM), which uses geostatistical methods to account for spatial similarity when estimating one or more ‘factors’. Each factor evolves over time following a density-dependent (Gompertz) process, and the log-density of each species is approximated as a linear combination of different factors. We demonstrate a JDSDM using two multispecies case studies (an annual survey of bottom-associated species in the Bering Sea and a seasonal survey of butterfly density in the continental USA), and also provide our code publicly as an R package. Main conclusions Case study applications show that that JDSDMs can be used for species ordination, i.e. showing that dynamics for butterfly species within the same genus are significantly more correlated than for species from different genera. We also demonstrate how JDSDMs can rapidly identify dominant patterns in community dynamics, including the decline and recovery of several Bering Sea fishes since 2008, and the ‘flight curves’ typical of early or late-emerging butterflies. We conclude by suggesting future research that could incorporate phylogenetic relatedness or functional similarity, and propose that our approach could be used to monitor community dynamics at large spatial and temporal scales.},

	abstract = {This study describes the spatial distribution of young-of-the-year sole based on autumnal beam trawl surveys conducted in the Bay of Biscay (France) during a 15-y period. Previous studies showed that habitat suitability for juvenile sole varies according to physical factors such as bathymetry, sediment structure and river plume influence. These factors, which are known exhaustively for the entire Bay of Biscay from static maps (bathymetry and granulometry) or temporal maps based on a hydrodynamic model (the river plume), were used as descriptors in a generalised linear model of habitat suitability in order to characterise the distribution of juvenile 0-group sole according to delta distribution. This model was used to identify the habitats in which juvenile 0-group sole are concentrated. The respective areas of these habitats were determined from a Geographic Information System (GIS), and their respective contribution to the sole population in the Bay of Biscay was calculated in terms of the estimated number of young fish (GIS area×density derived from the model). Despite the great variability of survey data, this quantitative approach emphasises the highly important role of restricted shallow, muddy estuarine areas as nursery grounds of sole in the Bay of Biscay and demonstrates the relation between interannual variations of nursery habitat capacity (with respect to estuarine extent) and sole recruitment.},

The spatial distribution of fish populations observed in the wild results from the complex interactions of multiple controls both external or internal to the fish populations. Whilst species distribution models (SDMs) have been mostly concerned with static description of species distribution as a function of environmental constraints, models of animal movements (MAMs) have focussed on the dynamic nature of spatial distribution of groups of individuals under a number of constraints external and internal to the population. Besides SDMs and MAMs, modelling the spatial distribution of fish populations can be achieved by models that are fundamentally static (like SDMs) but can also incorporate many hypotheses on the control of fish spatial distribution (like MAMs). The hypotheses underlying these models need to make sense at the population level - rather than at the individual or species level –we term these ‘population distribution models’ (PDMs). PDMs are statistical models that rely on several hypotheses, which include: (i) control through geographical attachment, (ii) environmental conditions, (iii) density-dependent habitat selection, (iv) spatial dependency, (v) population demographic structure, (vi) species interactions and (vii) population memory. We review the basis behind each of these conceptual models and we examine corresponding numerical applications. We argue that the conceptual models are complementary rather than competing, that existing numerical applications are still rarely compared and combined, and that PDMs can offer a statistical framework to achieve this. We recommend that the numerical models associated with different hypotheses be constructed within such a common general framework. This will permit evaluation, comparison and combination of the multiple hypotheses on fish spatial distribution. It will ultimately lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the factors controlling the spatial distribution of fish populations and to more accurate predictions in which model uncertainty is accounted for.},

About 6 months after we got our first Apple, John Glaister came through Vancouver and saw what we were doing and realized that his agency (New South Wales State Fisheries) had the same equipment and could run the same programs. John organized a training course in Australia where we showed about 25 Australian fisheries biologists how to use microcomputers to do many standard fisheries analyses. In the process of organizing this and sub sequent courses we developed a series of lecture notes. Over the last 10 years these notes have evolved into the chapters of this book.},

First, the relation between model-based variance estimates and covariance structure enabled estimation of survey precision for non-random survey designs. The possibility of using spatial covariance for optimising sampling strategy has been a second motive for using geostatistics. Kriging also offers the advantage of weighting data values, which is useful when sample points are clustered. This paper discusses, with fisheries applications, the different geostatistical models that characterise spatial variation, and their variance formulae for many different survey designs.

	abstract = {Abstract: Species’ assessments must frequently be derived from opportunistic observations made by volunteers (i.e., citizen scientists). Interpretation of the resulting data to estimate population trends is plagued with problems, including teasing apart genuine population trends from variations in observation effort. We devised a way to correct for annual variation in effort when estimating trends in occupancy (species distribution) from faunal or floral databases of opportunistic observations. First, for all surveyed sites, detection histories (i.e., strings of detection–nondetection records) are generated. Within-season replicate surveys provide information on the detectability of an occupied site. Detectability directly represents observation effort; hence, estimating detectablity means correcting for observation effort. Second, site-occupancy models are applied directly to the detection-history data set (i.e., without aggregation by site and year) to estimate detectability and species distribution (occupancy, i.e., the true proportion of sites where a species occurs). Site-occupancy models also provide unbiased estimators of components of distributional change (i.e., colonization and extinction rates). We illustrate our method with data from a large citizen-science project in Switzerland in which field ornithologists record opportunistic observations. We analyzed data collected on four species: the widespread Kingfisher (Alcedo atthis) and Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and the scarce Rock Thrush (Monticola saxatilis) and Wallcreeper (Tichodroma muraria). Our method requires that all observed species are recorded. Detectability was {\textless}1 and varied over the years. Simulations suggested some robustness, but we advocate recording complete species lists (checklists), rather than recording individual records of single species. The representation of observation effort with its effect on detectability provides a solution to the problem of differences in effort encountered when extracting trend information from haphazard observations. We expect our method is widely applicable for global biodiversity monitoring and modeling of species distributions.},

However, only a small fraction of the catch is typically analyzed for age as this is a costly and time-consuming process. Larger samples of the length distribution and a so-called age-length key (ALK) is then used to obtain the age distribution. Regional differences in ALKs are not uncommon, but stratification is often problematic due to a small number of samples. Here, we combine generalized additive modelling with continuation ratio logits to model the probability of age given length and spatial coordinates to overcome these issues. The method is applied to data gathered on North Sea haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), cod (Gadus morhua), whiting (Merlangius merlangus) and herring (Clupea harengus) and its implications for a simple age-based survey index of abundance are examined. The spatial varying ALK outperforms simpler approaches with respect to AIC and BIC, and the survey indices created using the spatial varying ALK displays better internal and external consistency indicating improved precision.},

The methods are applied to data on North Sea herring (Clupea harengus), sprat (Sprattus sprattus), and whiting (Merlangius merlangus), and the full stock assessments are carried out to evaluate the different indices produced. The stratified mean method is found much more imprecise than the alternatives based on GAMs, which are found to be similar.

In order to identify and locate potential nursery areas for spatio-temporal closures, a solid understanding of species− environment relationships is needed, as well as spatial identification of fish nurseries through the application of robust analyses. One way to achieve knowledge of fish nurseries is to analyse the persistence of recruitment hotspots. In this study, we propose the comparison of different spatiotemporal model structures to assess the persistence of a spatial process. In particular, we apply our approach to a 2-stage Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model that describes both the occurrence and the abundance of European hake Merluccius merluccius recruits in the western Mediterranean Sea. Results clearly show areas of high occurrence and abundance, mainly along the shelf break and the upper slope of the Spanish Mediterranean coast. Understanding the distributional patterns associated with key life stages such as recruitment is essential for appropriate spatial management, including the implementation of Fisheries Restricted Areas and/or Marine Protected Areas that improve the management of fishery resources.},

Elles visent principalement l'obtention de séries indices d'abondance pour les poissons plats et en particulier pour la sole. En conséquence, le choix a été fait d'adopter un chalut à perche pour se conformer aux normes du Conseil International pour l'Exploration de la Mer (CIEM) pour les poissons plats. Ce choix a permis de faire partie des campagnes coordonnées par le CIEM et ainsi d'être membre d'une communauté au sein de laquelle la méthodologie et les résultats peuvent être discutés chaque année lors des groupes de travail WGBEAM du CIEM.Depuis 2013, les campagnes ORHAGO sont utilisées pour l'évaluation de l'état du stock de sole du golfe de Gascogne. Elles permettent que cette évaluation soit analytique, c'est-à-dire effectuée avec un modèle permettant d'analyser et simuler la dynamique du stock. La sole est ainsi, avec le bar, une des deux seules ressources halieutiques internes au golfe de Gascogne pour laquelle ce niveau d'analyse peut être atteint et largement grâce à la série ORHAGO qui a un poids majeur dans l'évaluation.Outre la sole, les campagnes ORHAGO fournissent aussi des indices d'abondance pour l'ensemble des espèces pêchées, y compris le benthos non commercial. Elles sont ainsi une source d'informations sur l'évolution des peuplements et des habitats benthiques côtiers du golfe de Gascogne.Les campagnes ORHAGO permettent ainsi de : garantir la qualité de l'estimation de la mortalité par pêche subie par la sole, espèce économiquement majeure du golfe de Gascogne, disposer d'informations sur le recrutement de cette espèce pour améliorer les prévisions à court terme de l'effet de la pêche, avoir une série d'indices permettant de surveiller l'évolution des écosystèmes benthiques exploités par la pêche.},

	abstract = {Presence/absence data and presence-only data are the two customary sources for learning about species distributions over a region. We present an ambitious agenda with regard to the analysis of such data. We illuminate the fundamental modeling differences between the two types of data. Most simply, locations are considered to be fixed under presence/absence data; locations are random under presence-only data. The definition of “probability of presence” is incompatible between the two. We are not comfortable with modeling strategies in the literature that ignore this incompatibility and that assume that presence/absence modeling can be induced from presence-only specifications and, therefore, that fusion of presence-only and presence/absence data sources is routine. While, in some cases, data collection may not support this, we propose that, since, in nature, presence/absence is seen at the point locations, presence/absence data should be modeled at point level. If so, we need to specify two surfaces. The first provides the probability of presence at any location in the region. The second provides a realization from this surface in the form of a binary map yielding the results of Bernoulli trials across all locations; this surface is only partially observed. On the other hand, presence-only data should be modeled as a (partially observed) point pattern, arising from a random number of individuals seen at random locations, driven by specification of an intensity function. There is no notion of Bernoulli trials; events are associated with areas. We further suggest that, with just presence/absence data, preferential sampling of locations may arise. Accounting for this, using a shared process perspective, can improve our estimated presence/absence surface as well as prediction of presence. We further propose that preferential sampling can enable a probabilistically coherent fusion of the two data types. We illustrate with two real data sets, one presence/absence, one presence-only, for invasive species presence in New England in the United States. We demonstrate that potential bias in sampling locations can affect inference with regard to presence/absence and show that inference can be improved with preferential sampling ideas. We also provide a probabilistically coherent fusion of the two data sets again with the goal of improving inference for presence/absence. The importance of our work is to encourage more careful modeling when studying species distributions. Ignoring incompatibility between data types and adopting nongenerative modeling specifications results in invalid inference; the quantitative ecological community should benefit from this recognition.},

Statistical ecology has gelled over the past decade as a discipline that moves away from describing patterns towards modelling the ecological processes that generate these patterns. Following the fourth International Statistical Ecology Conference (1–4 July 2014) in Montpellier, France, we analyse current trends in statistical ecology. Important advances in the analysis of individual movement, and in the modelling of population dynamics and species distributions, are made possible by the increasing use of hierarchical and hidden process models. Exciting research perspectives include the development of methods to interpret citizen science data and of efficient, flexible computational algorithms for model fitting. Statistical ecology has come of age: it now provides a general and mathematically rigorous framework linking ecological theory and empirical data.},

	abstract = {Assessing the impacts of ongoing climate and anthropogenic-induced change on wildlife populations requires understanding species distributions and abundances across large spatial and temporal scales. For threatened or declining populations, collecting sufficient broad-scale data is challenging as sample sizes tend to be low because many such species are rare and/or elusive. As a result, demographic data are often piecemeal, leading to difficulties in determining causes of population changes and developing strategies to mitigate the effects of environmental stressors. Thus, the population dynamics of threatened species across spatio-temporal extents is typically inferred through incomplete, independent, local-scale studies. Emerging integrative modeling approaches, such as integrated population models (IPMs), combine multiple data types into a single analysis and provide a foundation for overcoming problems of sparse or fragmentary data. In this paper, we demonstrate how IPMs can be successfully implemented by synthesizing the elements, advantages, and novel insights of this modeling approach. We highlight the latest developments in IPMs that are explicitly relevant to the ecology and conservation of threatened species, including capabilities to quantify the spatial scale of management, source-sink dynamics, synchrony within metapopulations, and population density effects on demographic rates. Adoption of IPMs has led to improved detection of population declines, adaptation of targeted monitoring schemes, and refined management strategies. Continued methodological advancements of IPMs, such as incorporation of a wider set of data types (e.g., citizen science data) and coupled population-environment models, will allow for broader applicability within ecological and conservation sciences.},

	abstract = {Managing mixed fisheries requires understanding fishers’ behaviour to allow predicting future fisheries distribution and impact on marine ecosystems. A new approach was developed to compare fine-scale fishing effort distribution of Eastern English Channel (EEC) bottom trawlers to the monthly and spatially resolved abundance distributions of commercial species. First, the added value of using species-specific spatial overlap metric to quantify effective fishing effort and improve the relationship between fishing effort and fishing mortality was assessed. Second, based on the Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) theory, the species-specific weights given by fishers to different species were estimated by maximizing the overlap between target species assemblage and effort distributions in October. At a seasonal scale, our results emphasized the importance of cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) and red mullet (Mullus surmuletus) for the global distribution of EEC bottom trawlers. In October, cuttlefish and red mullet were clearly more determining fishers’ location choice than historically harvested species and also than the overall expected revenue. This is likely due to external constraints such as low cod (Gadus morhua) quota, causing IFD assumptions violated. This study evidenced the importance of getting good insights into spatiotemporal distributions of stocks and fleets to understand fishers’ behaviour and improve mixed fisheries management advice.},

	abstract = {Basic information on the distribution and habitat preferences of ecologically important species is essential for their management and protection. In the Mediterranean Sea there is increasing concern over elasmobranch species because their biological (ecological) characteristics make them highly vulnerable to fishing pressure. Their removal could affect the structure and function of marine ecosystems, inducing changes in trophic interactions at the community level due to the selective elimination of predators or prey species, competitors and species replacement. In this study Bayesian hierarchical spatial models are used to map the sensitive habitats of the three most caught elasmobranch species (Galeus melastomus, Scyliorhinus canicula, Etmopterus spinax) in the western Mediterranean Sea, based on fishery-dependent bottom trawl data. Results show that habitats associated with hard substrata and sandy beds, mainly in deep waters and with a high seabed gradient, have a greater probability registering the presence of the studied species than those associated with muddy shallow waters. Temperature and chlorophyll-α concentration show a negative relationship with S. canicula occurrence. Our results identify some of the sensitive habitats for elasmobranchs in the western Mediterranean Sea (GSA06 South), providing essential and easy-to-use interpretation tools, such as predictive distribution maps, with the final aim of improving management and conservation of these vulnerable species.},

	abstract = {Interpretation of fishery-dependent and independent-survey data requires accounting for changes in the proportion of local individuals that are caught by fishing gear (“catchability”). Catchability may be influenced by measured characteristics of fishing gear, and even standardized fishing techniques may experience changing catchability over time due to changes in fishing vessel characteristics and personnel. The importance of vessel power has long been recognized in the analysis of fishery dependent catch per unit effort data, but less-studied in the analysis of fishery independent data collected by research vessel surveys. Here we demonstrate how differences in catchability among vessels (“vessel effects”), as well as random variation in vessel-specific catchability over time (“vessel-year effects”) can be incorporated into generalized linear mixed models through their treatment as random effects. We apply these methods to data for 28 groundfish species caught in a standardized survey using contracted fishery vessels and personnel in the Northeast Pacific. Model selection shows that vessel, vessel-year, and both effects simultaneously are supported by available data for at least a few species. However, vessel-year effects generally have a larger effect on catch rates than vessel-effects and hence abundance indices estimated using both vessel- and vessel-year effects are generally similar to estimates when using just vessel-year effects. Additionally, models indicate little support for the hypothesis that characteristics such as length and displacement of the contracted vessels used in this survey have a substantial impact on catch rates. Finally, inclusion of vessel- or vessel-year effects generally results in wider estimates of credible intervals for resulting indices of abundance. This increased credible interval width is consistent with statistical theory, because vessel effects will result in non-independence of different sampling occasions, thus decreasing effective sample sizes. For this reason, we advocate that future analyses include vessel- and/or vessel-year effects when standardizing survey data from cooperative research programs.},

	abstract = {Accounting for variation in prey mortality and predator metabolic potential arising from spatial variation in consumption is an important task in ecology and resource management. However, there is no statistical method for processing stomach content data that accounts for fine-scale spatio-temporal structure while expanding individual stomach samples to population-level estimates of predation. Therefore, we developed an approach that fits a spatio-temporal model to both prey-biomass-per-predator-biomass data (i.e. the ratio of prey biomass in stomachs to predator weight) and predator biomass survey data, to predict “predator-expanded-stomach-contents” (PESCs). PESC estimates can be used to visualize either the annual landscape of PESCs (spatio-temporal variation), or can be aggregated across space to calculate annual variation in diet proportions (variation among prey items and among years). We demonstrated our approach in two contrasting scenarios: a data-rich situation involving eastern Bering Sea (EBS) large-size walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus, Gadidae) for 1992–2015; and a data-limited situation involving West Florida Shelf red grouper (Epinephelus morio, Epinephelidae) for 2011–2015. Large walleye pollock PESC was predicted to be higher in very warm years on the Middle Shelf of the EBS, where food is abundant. Red grouper PESC was variable in north-western Florida waters, presumably due to spatio-temporal variation in harmful algal bloom severity. Our approach can be employed to parameterize or validate diverse ecosystem models, and can serve to address many fundamental ecological questions, such as providing an improved understanding of how climate-driven changes in spatial overlap between predator and prey distributions might influence predation pressure.},

	abstract = {Marine biota are redistributing at a rapid pace in response to climate change and shifting seascapes. While changes in fish populations and community structure threaten the sustainability of fisheries, our capacity to adapt by tracking and projecting marine species remains a challenge due to data discontinuities in biological observations, lack of data availability, and mismatch between data and real species distributions. To assess the extent of this challenge, we review the global status and accessibility of ongoing scientific bottom trawl surveys. In total, we gathered metadata for 283,925 samples from 95 surveys conducted regularly from 2001 to 2019. We identified that 59\% of the metadata collected are not publicly available, highlighting that the availability of data is the most important challenge to assess species redistributions under global climate change. Given that the primary purpose of surveys is to provide independent data to inform stock assessment of commercially important populations, we further highlight that single surveys do not cover the full range of the main commercial demersal fish species. An average of 18 surveys is needed to cover at least 50\% of species ranges, demonstrating the importance of combining multiple surveys to evaluate species range shifts. We assess the potential for combining surveys to track transboundary species redistributions and show that differences in sampling schemes and inconsistency in sampling can be overcome with spatio-temporal modeling to follow species density redistributions. In light of our global assessment, we establish a framework for improving the management and conservation of transboundary and migrating marine demersal species. We provide directions to improve data availability and encourage countries to share survey data, to assess species vulnerabilities, and to support management adaptation in a time of climate-driven ocean changes.},

	abstract = {There is increasing need for methods that integrate multiple data types into a single analytical framework as the spatial and temporal scale of ecological research expands. Current work on this topic primarily focuses on combining capture–recapture data from marked individuals with other data types into integrated population models. Yet, studies of species distributions and trends often rely on data from unmarked individuals across broad scales where local abundance and environmental variables may vary. We present a modeling framework for integrating detection–nondetection and count data into a single analysis to estimate population dynamics, abundance, and individual detection probabilities during sampling. Our dynamic population model assumes that site-specific abundance can change over time according to survival of individuals and gains through reproduction and immigration. The observation process for each data type is modeled by assuming that every individual present at a site has an equal probability of being detected during sampling processes. We examine our modeling approach through a series of simulations illustrating the relative value of count vs. detection–nondetection data under a variety of parameter values and survey configurations. We also provide an empirical example of the model by combining long-term detection–nondetection data (1995–2014) with newly collected count data (2015–2016) from a growing population of Barred Owl (Strix varia) in the Pacific Northwest to examine the factors influencing population abundance over time. Our model provides a foundation for incorporating unmarked data within a single framework, even in cases where sampling processes yield different detection probabilities. This approach will be useful for survey design and to researchers interested in incorporating historical or citizen science data into analyses focused on understanding how demographic rates drive population abundance.},

	abstract = {Bottom trawl sampling is used to estimate trends in stock abundance for groundfishes worldwide, including Pacific rockfishes (Sebastes spp.). However, trawl sampling efficiency varies spatially and the distribution of groundfish populations may change among easy- and difficult-to-survey areas over time. These concerns have prompted interest in using underwater vehicles (UVs), for which catchability is likely to decrease less in rocky habitats. In this study, we use simulation modeling to evaluate the abundance trends arising from bottom trawl sampling given density-dependent habitat selection and spatially varying catchability. We first demonstrate that relative abundance indices in this case will generally be biased measures of changes in population abundance. We also propose and evaluate a sampling design that combines data from bottom trawl and UV gears. Combined sampling has greater precision than UV sampling, lower bias than bottom trawl sampling, and is robust to moderately violated assumptions regarding sampling strata or spatial catchability. We conclude by recommending future research that could test the assumptions under which combined sampling is a feasible solution to spatially varying catchability.},

A generalized linear model was used to account for differences in fishing power between boats and changes in prawn abundance. It was found that boats that used a GPS alone had 4\% greater fishing power than boats without a GPS. The addition of a plotter raised the power by 7\% over boats without the equipment. For each year between the first to third that a fisher has been working with plotters, there is an additional 2 or 3\% increase. It appears that when all boats have a GPS and plotter for at least 3 years, the fishing power of the fleet will increase by 12\%. Management controls have reduced the efficiency of each boat and lowered the number of days available to fish, but this may not have been sufficient to counteract the increases. Further limits will be needed to maintain the desired levels of mortality.},

	abstract = {Standardized catch per unit effort (CPUE) is a fundamental component of ﬁshery stock assessment. In multispecies ﬁsheries, catchability can differ depending on which species is being targeted, and so the yearly trend extracted from the standardized CPUE is likely to be biased. We have, therefore, developed a method for predicting the unobserved variable related to targeted species from among multispecies composition data using a mixture regression model for the transformed residuals. In contrast with traditional methods, the proposed method predicts the target variable in CPUE standardization without removing a subset of the data. Keeping the entire data set avoids information loss, and so CPUE standardization with the predicted target variable should yield an unbiased estimate of the yearly trend. Simple simulation tests demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional methods. We illustrate the use of our method by applying it to CPUE data on arabesque greenling (Pleurogrammus azonus) caught in multispecies trawl ﬁsheries in Hokkaido, Japan.},

A critical value of probability that best predicts target species presence and absence in the data set forms an objective basis for subsetting the trip records.

	abstract = {Protected and managed species, including harvested fishes, exhibit spatial and temporal variation in their distribution and productivity. Spatio-temporal variation can arise from differences in habitat quality, human impacts (including harvest), density-dependent changes in per capita productivity, as well as individual movement. Human impacts (e.g. direct harvest) also vary spatially and over time, and monitoring the overlap between impacts and population distribution is necessary to ensure that human impacts are sustainable and to prioritize research and management for populations that are heavily impacted. However, estimating spatio-temporal variation in human impacts and population dynamics while accounting for individual movement has remained computationally challenging for decades. We developed a spatial population growth (also known as ‘surplus production’) model that is inspired by finite element analysis, which estimates spatio-temporal population dynamics given density-dependent population regulation, individual movement and spatially explicit harvest. We demonstrate the method using data for big skate Raja binoculata in the California Current from 2003 to 2013 and demonstrate that results can be processed to estimate an upper limit on sustainable harvest (an ‘overfishing limit’). We also conduct a simulation experiment to explore the small-sample properties of parameter estimates. A simulation experiment confirms that real-world sample sizes are sufficient to estimate the sustainable harvest level within 20\% of its actual value. However, sample sizes are likely insufficient to reliably estimate movement rates. The spatial population growth model estimates an overfishing limit of 740–890 metric tonnes for big skate from 2010 to 2013, compared with annual harvest {\textless}100 tonnes. This suggests that recent harvest of big skate is likely sustainable, and sensitivity analysis confirms that this conclusion is robust to different potential rates for individual movement. Synthesis and applications. We recommend that spatio-temporal population models be used across systems and taxa to monitor the spatial overlap between species distribution and human impacts. For big skate, we recommend management rules triggering additional data collection and assessment effort if harvest rates substantially increase. We also recommend future research regarding spatial management regulations for emerging fisheries.},

	abstract = {Multispecies models are widely used to evaluate management trade-offs arising from species interactions. However, identifying climate impacts and sensitive habitats requires integrating spatial heterogeneity and environmental impacts into multispecies models at fine spatial scales. We therefore develop a spatio-temporal model of intermediate complexity for ecosystem assessments (a “MICE-in-space”), which is fitted to survey sampling data and time series of fishing mortality using maximum-likelihood techniques. The model is implemented in the VAST R package, and it can be configured to range from purely descriptive to including ratio-dependent interactions among species. We demonstrate this model using data for four groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska using data from 1982 to 2015. Model selection for this case-study shows that models with species interactions are parsimonious, although a model specifying separate density dependence without interactions also has substantial support. The AIC-selected model estimates a significant, negative impact of Alaska pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus, Gadidae) on productivity of other species and suggests that recent fishing mortality for Pacific cod (G. microcephalus, Gadidae) is above the biological reference point (BRP) resulting in 40\% of unfished biomass; other models show similar trends but different scales due to different BRP estimates. A simulation experiment shows that fitting a model with fewer species at a coarse spatial resolution degrades estimation performance, but that interactions and biological reference points can still be estimated accurately. We conclude that MICE-in-space models can simultaneously estimate fishing impacts, species trade-offs, biological reference points and habitat quality. They are therefore suitable to forecast short-term climate impacts, optimize survey designs and designate protected habitats.},

Of the different concepts that have been developed to understand individual fisher behaviour, random utility models (RUMs) have attracted considerable attention in the past three decades, and more particularly so since the 2000s. This study aimed at summarizing and analysing the information gathered from RUMs used during the last three decades around the globe. A methodology has been developed to standardize information across different studies and compare RUM results. The studies selected focused on fishing effort allocation. Six types of fisher behaviour drivers were considered: the presence of other vessels in the same fishing area, tradition, expected revenue, species targeting, costs, and risk-taking. Analyses were performed using three separate linear modelling approaches to assess the extent to which these different drivers impacted fisher behaviour in three fleet types: fleets fishing for demersal species using active gears, fleets fishing for demersal species using passive gears and fleets fishing for pelagic species. Fishers are attracted by higher expected revenue, tradition, species targeting and presence of others, but avoid choices involving large costs. Results also suggest that fishers fishing for demersal species using active gears are generally more influenced by past seasonal (long-term) patterns than by the most recent (short-term) information. Finally, the comparison of expected revenue with other fisher behaviour drivers highlights that demersal fishing vessels are risk-averse and that tradition and species targeting influence fisher decisions more than expected revenue.},

Here, we present a statistical model that combines spatio-temporal correlations with simple stock dynamics to estimate simultaneously how size distributions and spatial distributions develop in time. We demonstrate the method for a cod (Gadus morhua) population sampled by trawl surveys. Particular attention is paid to correlation between size classes within each trawl haul due to clustering of individuals with similar size. The model estimates growth, mortality, and reproduction, after which any aspect of size structure, spatio-temporal population dynamics, as well as the sampling process can be probed. This is illustrated by two applications: (i) tracking the spatial movements of a single cohort through time and (ii) predicting the risk of bycatch of undersized individuals. The method demonstrates that it is possible to combine stock assessment and spatio-temporal dynamics; however, this comes at a high computational cost. The model can be extended by increasing its ecological ﬁdelity, although computational feasibility eventually becomes limiting.},

Changes involve each individual in a decision-making process governed by his/her own goals or constraints.

Fishers have generally been treated as fixed elements, with no consideration of individual attitudes based on their operating scales (geographical, ecological, social and economic) and personal goals. We review existing research on the social, economic and behavioural dynamics of fishing to provide insight into fisher behaviour and its implications for fisheries management. Emphasis is placed on fisher perception, and how fishers develop dynamic fishing tactics and strategies as an adaptive response to changes in resource abundance, environmental conditions and market or regulatory constraints. We conclude that knowledge of these dynamics is essential for effective management, and we discuss how such information can be collected, analysed and integrated into fisheries assessment and management. Particular emphasis is placed on small-scale fisheries, but some examples from industrial fleets are provided to highlight similar issues in different types of fisheries.},

Zusammenfassung Schätzung des Seezungen-(Solea vulgaris, Quensel 1806) bestandes ab der Eiproduktion im Golf von Biskaya Der Seezungenbestand im Golf von Biskaya wurde ab der Eiproduktion während der gesamten Laichzeit (Januar bis Mai 1982) geschätzt. Die stratifizierte Erhebung der Laichgebiete erlaubte die Varianz dieser Produktion und einen Variationskoeffizienten von 17\% zu ermitteln. Die Erzeugerbiomasse beträgt ca. 15700 Tonnen. Diese Studie hat auch die Seeverhältnisse zur Zeit des Ablaichens sowie die raumzeitliche Verteilung der Laichplätze klargestellt. Summary Estimation of the common sole (Solea vulgaris, Quensel 1806) spawning stock by egg survey in the Bay of Biscay Estimate of sole spawning stock derived from total egg production (January to may) was conducted in the Bay of Biscay in 1982. The stratified sampling net-work on all the spawning ground permitted the calculation of the variance and of an average coefficient of variation (17\%). Spawning biomass assessment is around 15700 metric tonnes. This work give also data on spatio and temporal egg distribution related to the physical and chemical environment.},

	abstract = {Pioneered in the late 1980s, the concept of macroecology—a framework for studying ecological communities with a focus on patterns and processes—revolutionized the field. Although this approach has been applied mainly to terrestrial ecosystems, there is increasing interest in quantifying macroecological patterns in the sea and understanding the processes that generate them. Taking stock of the current work in the field and advocating a research agenda for the decades ahead, Marine Macroecology draws together insights and approaches from a diverse group of scientists to show how marine ecology can benefit from the adoption of macroecological approaches. Divided into three parts, Marine Macroecology first provides an overview of marine diversity patterns and offers case studies of specific habitats and taxonomic groups. In the second part, contributors focus on process-based explanations for marine ecological patterns. The third part presents new approaches to understanding processes driving the macroecolgical patterns in the sea. Uniting unique insights from different perspectives with the common goal of identifying and understanding large-scale biodiversity patterns, Marine Macroecology will inspire the next wave of marine ecologists to approach their research from a macroecological perspective.},

The great value of the Apple II + was that we could take the computer programs we had been building on mainframe and mini-computers, and make them available to the many fisheries biologists who also had Apple II + 's. About 6 months after we got our first Apple, John Glaister came through Vancouver and saw what we were doing and realized that his agency (New South Wales State Fisheries) had the same equipment and could run the same programs. John organized a training course in Australia where we showed about 25 Australian fisheries biologists how to use microcomputers to do many standard fisheries analyses. In the process of organizing this and sub­ sequent courses we developed a series of lecture notes. Over the last 10 years these notes have evolved into the chapters of this book.},

	abstract = {Understanding and accurately modeling species distributions lies at the heart of many problems in ecology, evolution, and conservation. Multiple sources of data are increasingly available for modeling species distributions, such as data from citizen science programs, atlases, museums, and planned surveys. Yet reliably combining data sources can be challenging because data sources can vary considerably in their design, gradients covered, and potential sampling biases. We review, synthesize, and illustrate recent developments in combining multiple sources of data for species distribution modeling. We identify five ways in which multiple sources of data are typically combined for modeling species distributions. These approaches vary in their ability to accommodate sampling design, bias, and uncertainty when quantifying environmental relationships in species distribution models. Many of the challenges for combining data are solved through the prudent use of integrated species distribution models: models that simultaneously combine different data sources on species locations to quantify environmental relationships for explaining species distribution. We illustrate these approaches using planned survey data on 24 species of birds coupled with opportunistically collected eBird data in the southeastern United States. This example illustrates some of the benefits of data integration, such as increased precision in environmental relationships, greater predictive accuracy, and accounting for sample bias. Yet it also illustrates challenges of combining data sources with vastly different sampling methodologies and amounts of data. We provide one solution to this challenge through the use of weighted joint likelihoods. Weighted joint likelihoods provide a means to emphasize data sources based on different criteria (e.g., sample size), and we find that weighting improves predictions for all species considered. We conclude by providing practical guidance on combining multiple sources of data for modeling species distributions.},

	abstract = {In this work, we consider a hierarchical spatio-temporal model for particulate matter (PM) concentration in the North-Italian region Piemonte. The model involves a Gaussian Field (GF), affected by a measurement error, and a state process characterized by a first order autoregressive dynamic model and spatially correlated innovations. This kind of model is well discussed and widely used in the air quality literature thanks to its flexibility in modelling the effect of relevant covariates (i.e. meteorological and geographical variables) as well as time and space dependence. However, Bayesian inference—through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques—can be a challenge due to convergence problems and heavy computational loads. In particular, the computational issue refers to the infeasibility of linear algebra operations involving the big dense covariance matrices which occur when large spatio-temporal datasets are present. The main goal of this work is to present an effective estimating and spatial prediction strategy for the considered spatio-temporal model. This proposal consists in representing a GF with Matérn covariance function as a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) through the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approach. The main advantage of moving from a GF to a GMRF stems from the good computational properties that the latter enjoys. In fact, GMRFs are defined by sparse matrices that allow for computationally effective numerical methods. Moreover, when dealing with Bayesian inference for GMRFs, it is possible to adopt the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) algorithm as an alternative to MCMC methods giving rise to additional computational advantages. The implementation of the SPDE approach through the R-library INLA (www.r-inla.org) is illustrated with reference to the Piemonte PM data. In particular, providing the step-by-step R-code, we show how it is easy to get prediction and probability of exceedance maps in a reasonable computing time.},

Analyses start with standardized data formats for logbook (EFLALO) and VMS (TACSAT), enabling users to conduct a variety of analyses using generic algorithms. Embedded functionality handles erroneous data point detection and removal, métier identification through the use of clustering techniques, linking logbook and VMS data together in order to distinguish fishing from other activities, provide high-resolution maps of both fishing effort and -landings, interpolate vessel tracks, calculate indicators of fishing impact as listed under the Data Collection Framework at different spatio-temporal scales. Finally data can be transformed into other existing formats, for example to populate regional databases like FishFrame. This paper describes workflow examples of these features while online material allows a head start to perform these analyses. This software incorporates state-of-the art VMS and logbook analysing methods standardizing the process towards obtaining pan-European, or even worldwide indicators of fishing distribution and impact as required for spatial planning.},

	abstract = {Spatial stock assessments have been developed to address violations of the dynamic pool assumption that the region to be assessed contains a single homogeneous stock. The possibility of such violation is often evident in data that suggest different trends in abundance or catch / survey age- / size-structure among areas that cannot be explained simply by the fishing history among areas. Currently, most stock assessments account for spatial structure using the ‘areas-as-fleets’ approach in which fishery or survey selectivity and catchability are assumed to differ spatially. However, several simulation studies suggest that adopting spatial approaches to stock assessment will improve estimation performance compared to the areas-as-fleets approach or ignoring spatial structure when conducting stock assessments, although at the cost of a larger number of estimable parameters. Spatial approaches to stock assessment and the provision of management advice have been available since the 1950s. However, spatial stock assessments only became adopted for management purposes in the 1990s, with the widespread adoption of the “integrated approach” to stock assessment, which allowed the use of multiple data sets for parameter estimation. The number of spatial stock assessments is now increasing rapidly. This paper outlines some of the key decisions that need to be made when conducting a spatial stock assessment (number of areas, how to model recruitment, movement, growth and dispersal, and model parameterization).},

	abstract = {Integrated analysis (or integrated population modelling) methods have become the preferred approach for conducting stock assessments, and providing the basis for management advice for fish and invertebrate stocks since the publication of a seminal paper by Fournier and Archibald in 1982. Methods to assess fish stocks based on single-species, single-area, age-structured models are now standard, with the major debates associated with these models related to data choice, model configuration assumptions, and data weighting. However, the current generation of stock assessment packages is not addressing all of the needs of stock assessment analysts and managers. A major challenge for any next-generation stock assessment package is the set of extensions needed to assess stocks that do not satisfy the ‘well-mixed single-stock’ paradigm. In addition, the next-generation stock assessment package needs to: (a) be able to capture age and size/stage dynamics simultaneously yet computationally efficiently, (b) scale from data-rich to data-poor, (c) include some multi-species capability, and (d) more appropriately deal with temporal variation (e.g., random effects and state-space models). In relation to data, there is a need to ensure that the next-generation stock assessment package better handles tagging data (age-size/stage models may help in this regard), in particular, to be able to use close-kin mark-recapture data. Efficient methods are needed to share parameter priors among stocks (satisfying the promise of the ‘Robin Hood’ paradigm). The next-generation stock assessment package needs to have associated appropriate training programs and documentation. Adoption of such a package will be facilitated by a data entry system that is well-documented, does not require specification of inputs that will not be used in an application, has an expert system to configure default settings based on best practices, and has associated code to automatically produce diagnostic statistics. Some technical challenges that have plagued stock assessment for decades warrant continued attention (at the theoretical and applied level) such as automatic data weighting and tuning, how to handle spatial and stock structure, improved coding to facilitate application of state-of-the-art methods for quantifying uncertainty, and adoption of true state-space formulations to allow more parameters to be treated as random effects. Future needs for features cannot be anticipated, so the key design consideration for the next-generation stock assessment package is to be flexible and modifiable to meet the requirements of analysts and users.},

These assessments generally include relative abundance index data, length-composition information and conditional age-at-length data, and algorithms have been developed to select weighting factors for each of these data types. This paper introduces methods for weighting conditional age-at-length data that extend an approach developed by Francis (2011) to weight age- and length-composition data. Simulation based on single-zone and two-zone operating models are used to compare five tuning methods that are constructed as combinations of methods to weight each data type. The single-zone operating models allow evaluation of the tuning methods in terms of their ability to provide unbiased estimates of management-related quantities and the correct data weights in the absence of model mis-specification, while the two-zone operating models allow the impacts of model mis-specification on the performance of tuning methods to be explored. The results of assessments are sensitive to data weighting, but the choice of method for data weighting is most consequential when there is model mis-specification. Overall, the results indicate that arithmetic averaging of effective sampling sample sizes from the McAllister and Ianelli (1997) approach is inferior to other methods, and the new method for computing effective sample sizes for conditional age-at-length data seems most appropriate.},

	abstract = {Abundance indices derived from fisheries-dependent data (catch-per-unit-effort or CPUE) are known to have potential for bias, in part because of the usual non-random nature of fisheries spatial distributions. However, given the cost and lack of availability of fisheries-independent surveys, fisheries-dependent CPUE remains a common and informative input to fisheries stock assessments. Recent research efforts have focused on the development of spatiotemporal delta-generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) which simultaneously standardize the CPUE and predict abundance in unfished areas when estimating the abundance index. These models can include local seasonal environmental covariates (e.g. sea surface temperature) and a spatially varying response to regional annual indices (e.g. the El Niño Southern Oscillation) to interpolate into unfished areas. Spatiotemporal delta-GLMMs have been demonstrated in simulation studies to perform better than conventional, non-spatial delta-generalized linear models (GLMs). However, spatiotemporal delta-GLMMs have rarely been evaluated in situations where fisheries spatial sampling patterns change over time (e.g. fisheries expansion or spatial closures). This study develops a simulation framework to evaluate 1) how the nature of fisheries-dependent spatial sampling patterns may bias estimated abundance indices, 2) how shifts in spatial sampling over time impact our ability to estimate temporal changes in catchability, and 3) how including seasonal environmental covariates and/or regional annual indices in spatiotemporal delta-GLMMs can improve the estimation of abundance indices given shifts in spatial sampling. Spatiotemporal delta-GLMMs are then applied to a case study example where the spatial sampling pattern changed dramatically over time (contraction of the Japanese pole-and-line fishery for skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis in the western and central Pacific Ocean). Results from simulations indicate that spatial sampling in proportion to the underlying biomass can produce similar abundance indices to those produced under random sampling. Though estimated abundance indices were not perfect, spatiotemporal GLMMs were generally able to disentangle shifts in spatial sampling from temporal changes in catchability when shifts in spatial sampling were not too extreme. Lastly, the inclusion of seasonal environmental covariates and/or regional oceanographic indices in spatiotemporal GLMMs did not improve abundance index estimation and in some cases resulted in degraded model performance.},

	abstract = {Indices of abundance are the bedrock for stock assessments or empirical management procedures used to manage ﬁshery catches for ﬁsh populations worldwide, and are generally obtained by processing catch-rate data. Recent research suggests that geostatistical models can explain a substantial portion of variability in catch rates via the location of samples (i.e. whether located in high- or low-density habitats), and thus use available catch-rate data more efﬁciently than conventional “design-based” or stratiﬁed estimators. However, the generality of this conclusion is currently unknown because geostatistical models are computationally challenging to simulation-test and have not previously been evaluated using multiple species. We develop a new maximum likelihood estimator for geostatistical index standardization, which uses recent improvements in estimation for Gaussian random ﬁelds. We apply the model to data for 28 groundﬁsh species off the U.S. West Coast and compare results to a previous “stratiﬁed” index standardization model, which accounts for spatial variation using post-stratiﬁcation of available data. This demonstrates that the stratiﬁed model generates a relative index with 60\% larger estimation intervals than the geostatistical model. We also apply both models to simulated data and demonstrate (i) that the geostatistical model has well-calibrated conﬁdence intervals (they include the true value at approximately the nominal rate), (ii) that neither model on average under- or overestimates changes in abundance, and (iii) that the geostatistical model has on average 20\% lower estimation errors than a stratiﬁed model. We therefore conclude that the geostatistical model uses survey data more efﬁciently than the stratiﬁed model, and therefore provides a more cost-efﬁcient treatment for historical and ongoing ﬁsh sampling data.},

	abstract = {Spatial management of discards has recently been proposed as a useful tool for the protection of juveniles, by reducing discard rates and can be used as a buffer against management errors and recruitment failure. In this study Bayesian hierarchical spatial models have been used to analyze about 440 trawl fishing operations of two different metiers, sampled between 2009 and 2012, in order to improve our understanding of factors that influence the quantity of discards and to identify their spatio-temporal distribution in the study area. Our analysis showed that the relative importance of each variable was different for each metier, with a few similarities. In particular, the random vessel effect and seasonal variability were identified as main driving variables for both metiers. Predictive maps of the abundance of discards and maps of the posterior mean of the spatial component show several hot spots with high discard concentration for each metier. We argue how the seasonal/spatial effects, and the knowledge about the factors influential to discarding, could potentially be exploited as potential mitigation measures for future fisheries management strategies. However, misidentification of hotspots and uncertain predictions can culminate in inappropriate mitigation practices which can sometimes be irreversible. The proposed Bayesian spatial method overcomes these issues, since it offers a unified approach which allows the incorporation of spatial random-effect terms, spatial correlation of the variables and the uncertainty of the parameters in the modeling process, resulting in a better quantification of the uncertainty and accurate predictions.},

In the Mediterranean Sea there is increasing concern over elasmobranch species because their biological (ecological) characteristics make them highly vulnerable to fishing pressure. Their removal could affect the structure and function of marine ecosystems, inducing changes in trophic interactions at the community level due to the selective elimination of predators or prey species, competitors and species replacement. In this study Bayesian hierarchical spatial models are used to map the sensitive habitats of the three most caught elasmobranch species (Galeus melastomus, Scyliorhinus canicula, Etmopterus spinax) in the western Mediterranean Sea, based on fishery-dependent bottom trawl data. Results show that habitats associated with hard substrata and sandy beds, mainly in deep waters and with a high seabed gradient, have a greater probability registering the presence of the studied species than those associated with muddy shallow waters. Temperature and chlorophyll-α concentration show a negative relationship with S. canicula occurrence. Our results identify some of the sensitive habitats for elasmobranchs in the western Mediterranean Sea (GSA06 South), providing essential and easy-to-use interpretation tools, such as predictive distribution maps, with the final aim of improving management and conservation of these vulnerable species.},

For many species, we must rely on several indices that routinely conflict with each other and which may result in biased and uncertain outputs. Here, we explored whether reconciled trends obtained from dynamic factor analysis (DFA) applied to conflicting indices can be used as a trend of relative abundance input into a stock assessment model. We simulated an age-structured population of two coastal shark species in the southeast United States to generate multiple disagreeing indices, reconciled the indices using DFA, and then inserted both the multiple conflicting survey indices and the simplified DFA-predicted trend into respective stock assessment models. We compared the results of each stock assessment model to simulated values to evaluate the relative performance of each approach. We found that the DFA-based assessment generally performed similarly to the conflicting index-based assessment and may be a useful assessment tool in situations where conflicting indices with different selectivities, catchabilities, variances, and missing data are present. DFA assessment results were more consistent across simulation scenarios and outperformed many conflicting index assessments when surveys underwent shifts in catchability and the underlying stock abundance exhibited contrast.},

	abstract = {Delta-models (a.k.a. hurdle models) are widely used to fit biomass samples that include zeros and a skewed response for positive catches, and spatio-temporal extensions of these models are increasingly used to quantify trends in abundance (i.e., estimate abundance indices). Previous research has shown estimated indices are proportional to changes in abundance. However, little research has tested the performance of delta-models for estimating “scale”; that is, whether abundance indices are not just proportional to population changes but also have the correct absolute value. We use data for twenty species in the eastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska as well as a factorial experiment conditioned on data for Gulf of Alaska Pacific cod to support five conclusions related to scale in spatio-temporal delta-models. First, we show that conventional (nonspatial) delta-models are surprisingly sensitive to the a priori choice of probability distribution for positive catches, where gamma and Tweedie models give similar scale estimates but other distributions generally differ. Second, these same distributions also estimate widely different scales when using spatio-temporal delta-models, and the delta-gamma and Tweedie models provide similar scale to design-based indices. Third, model selection using marginal AIC often identifies the lognormal distribution as most parsimonious, despite it resulting in systematically higher abundance than design-based indices for many species. Fourth, scale is sensitive to the spatial resolution (i.e., number of knots) used in fitting the spatio-temporal model when using a naïve “empirical Bayes” estimator, but less sensitive when applying an epsilon bias-correction estimator. Fifth, the factorial simulation experiment suggests that the Tweedie and delta-gamma distributions perform well even when applied to data simulated from an inverse-Gaussian or lognormal distribution, whereas the opposite is not true. We conclude that index scale is sensitive to delta-model specification, and we make five recommendations when using spatio-temporal delta-models for index standardization: (1) apply the epsilon or other bias-correction methods to reduce sensitivity of index scale on spatio-temporal model resolution; either (2) compare the scale of delta-model indices with that of design-based indices when design-based indices are available or (3) use the delta-gamma or Tweedie distribution by default when design-based indices are not available; (4) do not assume that AIC will identify the model specification that results in the most appropriate scale; and (5) consider apparent mismatches in index scale depending upon whether an assessment model specifies or estimates the associated catchability coefficient and whether the design-based index is believed to measure total abundance for a fully-selected age or length-class.},

Advantages include (and are not limited to) clarification of what the response variable is that is modelled; a framework for choosing the number and location of quadrature points (commonly referred to as pseudo-absences or ‘background points’) objectively; clarity of model assumptions and tools for checking them; models to handle spatial dependence between points when it is present; and ways forward regarding difficult issues such as accounting for sampling bias.

Within this context, the awareness of the spatial distribution of potential unwanted catches is important for devising management measures aimed to decrease discards. This study analyzed the distribution of Hot Spot density areas of demersal fish and crustaceans below the Minimum Conservation Reference Size (MCRS) in four different southern European seas: continental Portuguese coast, Catalan Sea, South of Sicily, Liguria and northern Tyrrhenian Seas using both bottom trawl survey data and information on the spatial distribution of commercial fisheries. Critical areas for discarding were identified as zones where the highest densities of individuals below MCRS were consistently recorded throughout a series of years. Results clearly showed a patchy distribution of undersized individuals in each investigated area, highlighting the overlap between high density patches of both discards and fishing effort. The present findings provide a relevant knowledge for supporting the application of spatial-based management actions, such as the designation of Fisheries Restricted Areas (FRAs), in order to minimize the by-catch of undersized specimens and improve the sustainability of demersal fisheries.},

Peru's small-scale elasmobranch gillnet fishery captures thousands of sharks and rays each year, and incidentally captures sea turtles, marine mammals and seabirds. We assessed the ability of a dedicated fisheries remote electronic monitoring (REM) camera to identify and quantify captures in this fishery by comparing its performance to on-board observer reports. Cameras were installed across five boats with a total of 228 fishing sets monitored. Of these, 169 sets also had on-board fisheries observers present. The cameras were shown to be an effective tool for identifying catch, with {\textgreater}90\% detection rates for 9 of 12 species of elasmobranchs caught. Detection rates of incidental catch were more variable (sea turtle=50\%; cetacean=80\%; pinniped=100\%). The ability to quantify target catch from camera imagery degraded for fish quantities exceeding 15 individuals. Cameras were more effective at quantifying rays than sharks for small catch quantities (x≤15 fish), whereas size affected camera performance for large catches (x{\textgreater}15 fish). Our study showed REM to be effective in detecting and quantifying elasmobranch target catch and pinniped bycatch in Peru's small-scale fishery, but not, without modification, in detecting and quantifying sea turtle and cetacean bycatch. We showed REM can provide a time- and cost-effective method to monitor target catch in small-scale fisheries and can be used to overcome some deficiencies in observer reports. With modifications to the camera specifications, we expect performance to improve for all target catch and bycatch species.},

Bycatch estimates are typically calculated using data collected by on-board observers, but observer programmes are costly and therefore often only cover a small percentage of the fishery. The challenge is then to estimate bycatch for the unobserved fishing activity. The status quo for most fisheries is to assume the ratio of bycatch to effort is constant and multiply this ratio by the effort in the unobserved activity (ratio estimator). We used a dataset with 100\% observer coverage, 35 440 hauls from the US west coast groundfish trawl fishery, to evaluate the ratio estimator against methods that utilize fine-scale spatial information: generalized additive models (GAMs) and random forests. Applied to 15 species representing a range of bycatch rates, including spatial locations improved model predictive ability, whereas including effort-associated covariates generally did not. Random forests performed best for all species (lower root mean square error), but were slightly biased (overpredicting total bycatch). Thus, the choice of bycatch estimation method involves a tradeoff between bias and precision, and which method is optimal may depend on the species bycatch rate and how the estimates are to be used.},

            We evaluated the spatial distribution of otter trawl fishing effort and catches resulting from the imposition in 1994 of year-round and seasonal groundfish closed areas off the NE USA. Vessel locations were available from logbooks, vessel monitoring system (VMS) data from many of the largest vessels, and from observer records. There was high spatial coherence between VMS- and observer-derived trawling locations. Prior to establishment, 31\% of trawl effort (1991–1993) occurred within the 22 000 km2 of area that would eventually be closed year-round. In 2001–2003 about 10\% of effort targeting groundfish was deployed within 1 km of the marine protected area (MPA) boundaries, and about 25\% within 5 km. Density gradients, consistent with spill-over from MPAs, were apparent for some species. Average revenue per hour trawled was about twice as high within 4 km of the boundary, than for more distant catches, but the catch variability was greater nearer closed area boundaries. Seasonal closed areas attracted more fishing effort after opening than prior to closure even while average cpue was the same or lower. Spatial resolution of traditional data sources (e.g., logbooks) was too crude to discern detailed MPA-related effects, as revealed by high-resolution vessel positions from VMS and catch data obtained by observers.},

The results reveal that marine landscapes with coarse or mixed sediments and weak or moderate tide stress are heavily ﬁshed. Marine landscapes experienced different intensities of ﬁshing pressure depending on their spatial location in UK offshore waters and the regional heterogeneity of landscape types. Spatial patterns of ﬁshing pressure vary by region, but within regions, patches of high ﬁshing pressure remain centred at the same locations. When designing marine management plans, it is important to take account of the spatial extent and patchiness of ﬁshing activity, and the consistency with which areas are ﬁshed in the same region from year to year. Descriptions of the spatial distribution of ﬁshing pressures will become more meaningful at a local level if they also reﬂect the sensitivity of the habitats to those pressures. The further development of such sensitivity analyses, using life-history traits or measures of benthic production, is now becoming a priority.},

This type of behaviour is known to exist within pair trawlers, since these vessels are in pairs at least during their fishing operations. To identify partners at sea, we used a heuristic approach based on joint-movement metrics computed from vessel monitoring system data and Gaussian mixture models. The models were fitted to joint-movement metrics of the pelagic pair trawlers, and subsequently used to identify partners at sea in other fleets. We found partners at sea in all of the fleets except for the tuna purse-seiners. We then analysed the connections between vessels and identified exclusive partners. Exclusiveness was more common in pelagic pair trawlers and small bottom otter trawlers, with 82\% and 74\% of the vessels involved in partnerships having exclusive partners. This work shows that there are collective tactics at least at a pairwise level in diverse fisheries in the world.},

In the first week after the closure, the catch rate decreased by 14\%, coinciding with an increase in crowding of 28\%. Area specialisation affected the response of individual vessels because vessels without prior experience in the open areas showed a larger decline in catch rate compared with vessels that previously fished in these open areas and were more likely to stop fishing during the closed period. The decrease in catch rate in response to the increase in competitor density allowed us to estimate the strength of the interference competition.},

On the one hand, data obtained from scientific surveys are not available all year through, but are considered to provide consistent yearly and spatially resolved abundance indices. On the other hand, on-board commercial data do cover the whole year, but generally provide a biased perception of stock abundance. The combination of scientific and commercial catches per unit of effort (CPUEs), standardized using a delta-generalized linear model, allowed to infer spatial and monthly dynamics of fish distributions in the EEC, which could be compared with previous knowledge on their life cycles. Considering the scientific survey as a repository, the degree of reliability of commercial CPUEs was assessed with survey-based distribution using the Local Index of Collocation. Large scale information was in agreement with literature, especially for cuttlefish. Fine scale consistency between survey and commercial data was significant for half of the 19 tested species (e.g. whiting, cod). For the other species (e.g. plaice, thornback ray), the results were inconclusive, mainly owing to poor commercial data coverage and/or to particular aspects of the species biology.},

Existing knowledge about each fishery is stored in a database included in the software, and may be easily modified. This includes the parameters describing each population and each fishing activity. Furthermore, the software allows for flexibility in several model assumptions. Both management measures and behaviour of fishermen in reaction to these measures may be interactively designed through a Script language.

	abstract = {In order to provide reliable scientific advice and support for fisheries management, it is necessary to evaluate the biological and economic sustainability of complex fisheries, such as multi-species multi-fleet fisheries. Existing policy-screening modelling tools are not fully suitable in this purpose due to either an over-simplified description of population dynamics, or due to the lack of consideration of economic aspects. In this paper, we present a package that enables quantitative bioeconomic assessment of management scenarios. Population dynamics is described through spatially- and seasonally-explicit models. Exploitation dynamics is characterized by several fishing activities with specific spatial and seasonal features, and practiced by several kinds of vessels with specific technical characteristics. Exploitation costs and revenues are considered at several levels: the fishing trip, the fishing unit (vessel and crew), and the vessel owner. The model is generic and can be used for different types of fisheries. A database is attached to the software for the storage and updating of information for each fishery. This includes the specification of model dimensions and of the parameters describing populations and exploitation. Several model assumptions regarding either population or exploitation may be adapted to suit a specific fishery. Both policies and corresponding fishers’ response may be interactively specified through JAVA™ scripts. This version of ISIS-Fish allows for the calculation of biological and economic consequences of a range of policies, including conventional ones like catch and effort controls, and alternative policies such as marine protected areas. To facilitate policy-screening in a high-dimension parameter space, the software includes features, like interfaces for sensitivity analysis and simulation queues.},

	abstract = {Maritime spatial planning (MSP) and fishery management may generate extra costs for fisheries by constraining fishers activity with conservation areas and new utilizations of the sea. More energy-efficient fisheries are also likely to alter existing fishing patterns, which already vary from fishery to fishery and from vessel to vessel. The impact assessment of new spatial plans involving fisheries should be based on quantitative bioeconomic analyses that take into account individual vessel decisions, and trade-offs in cross-sector conflicting interests. We use a vessel-oriented decision-support tool (the DISPLACE model) to combine stochastic variations in spatial fishing activities with harvested resource dynamics in scenario projections. The assessment computes economic and stock status indicators by modelling the activity of Danish, Swedish, and German vessels (\&gt;12 m) in the international western Baltic Sea commercial fishery, together with the underlying size-based distribution dynamics of the main fishery resources of sprat, herring, and cod. The outcomes of alternative scenarios for spatial effort displacement are exemplified by evaluating the fishers's abilities to adapt to spatial plans under various constraints. Interlinked spatial, technical, and biological dynamics of vessels and stocks in the scenarios result in stable profits, which compensate for the additional costs from effort displacement and release pressure on the fish stocks. The effort is further redirected away from sensitive benthic habitats, enhancing the ecological positive effects. The energy efficiency of some of the vessels, however, is strongly reduced with the new zonation, and some of the vessels suffer decreased profits. The DISPLACE model serves as a spatially explicit bioeconomic benchmark tool for management strategy evaluations for capturing tactical decision-making in reaction to MSP.},

The distribution of the UK fleet of large ({\textgreater}15m length) fishing vessels was analysed and clear gear-specific temporal and spatial differences in activity were found. Mobile demersal gears had the highest intensity and widest distribution of activity in the study area, and so might be expected to have the most widespread ecosystem-level impacts. The potential effects of two proposed fisheries closures; a planned wave energy testing facility (Wave Hub) and a candidate offshore Marine Protected Area (Haig Fras) are described. Maps indicate that mobile demersal gear fleets would be little affected if they were excluded from these proposed closures, but if the static gear fleets were excluded this would likely result in displacement of certain vessels, increasing fishing pressure on other rocky grounds and other fishers. Predictions concerning the effects of fisheries displacement can be improved through the use of high-resolution gear-specific activity data. This study shows that VMS can provide an invaluable source of such data, provided that gear information is made available to fisheries managers and scientists.},

	abstract = {Developing Species Distribution Models (SDM) for marine exploited species is a major challenge in fisheries ecology. Classical modelling approaches typically rely on fish research survey data. They benefit from a standardized sampling design and a controlled catchability, but they usually occur once or twice a year and they may sample a relatively small number of spatial locations. Spatial monitoring of commercial data (based on logbooks crossed with Vessel Monitoring Systems) can provide an additional extensive data source to inform fish spatial distribution. We propose a spatial hierarchical framework integrating both data sources while accounting for preferential sampling (PS) of commercial data. From simulations, we demonstrate that PS should be accounted for in estimation when PS is actually strong. When commercial data far exceed scientific data, the later bring little information to spatial predictions in the areas sampled by commercial data, but bring information in areas with low fishing intensity and provide a validation dataset to assess the integrated model consistency. We applied the framework to three demersal species (hake, sole, and squids) in the Bay of Biscay that emphasize contrasted PS intensity and we demonstrate that the framework can account for several fleets with varying catchabilities and PS behaviours.},

Whereas simulation-based Bayesian inference through Markov Chain Monte Carlo may be hampered by slow convergence and numerical instabilities, the inferential framework of Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) is capable to provide accurate and relatively fast analytical approximations to posterior quantities of interest. It heavily relies on the use of Gauss-Markov dependence structures to avoid the numerical bottleneck of high-dimensional nonsparse matrix computations. With a view towards space-time applications, we here review the principal theoretical concepts, model classes and inference tools within the INLA framework. Important elements to construct space-time models are certain spatial Matern-like Gauss-Markov random fields, obtained as approximate solutions to a stochastic partial differential equation. Efficient implementation of statistical inference tools for a large variety of models is available through the INLA package of the R software. To showcase the practical use of R-INLA and to illustrate its principal commands and syntax, a comprehensive simulation experiment is presented using simulated non Gaussian space-time count data with a first-order autoregressive dependence structure in time.},

The framework uses species sales notes by commercial size category, the length and age composition of commercial sizes from onshore sampling and the fishing ground and fishing effort from vessel monitoring system records. We apply the framework to horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), one of the most important commercially exploited stocks throughout the Northeast Atlantic, using data collected during 2017 in Portuguese waters. We show that high-resolution mapping of the species annual landings by commercial size category and age group can already reveal different distribution patterns by life stage. We further examined, with daily resolution, the variability in the proportion of adult fish by trip, finding differences along the coast and a seasonal pattern indicating that spawning occurred mainly over the slope and adult horse mackerel dominated in the South zone over the year. The framework can be applied to an extended stock area and for several years to investigate migration patterns across areas as well as intra- and inter-annual changes in the species overall distribution. In addition, its application on a trip basis for the species ensemble landed can provide overriding information for the accuracy of mixed fisheries models and management.},

	abstract = {The European Union and other states are moving towards Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management to balance food production and security with wider ecosystem concerns. Fishing is only one of several sectors operating within the ocean environment, competing for renewable and non-renewable resources that overlap in a limited space. Other sectors include marine mining, energy generation, recreation, transport and conservation. Trade-offs of these competing sectors are already part of the process but attempts to detail how the seas are being utilised have been primarily based on compilations of data on human activity at large spatial scales. Advances including satellite and shipping automatic tracking enable investigation of factors influencing fishers’ choice of fishing grounds at spatial scales relevant to decision-making, including the presence or avoidance of activities by other sectors. We analyse the determinants of English and Welsh scallop-dredging fleet behaviour, including competing sectors, operating in the eastern English Channel. Results indicate aggregate mining activity, maritime traffic, increased fishing costs, and the English inshore 6 and French 12 nautical mile limits negatively impact fishers’ likelihood of fishing in otherwise suitable areas. Past success, net-benefits and fishing within the 12 NM predispose fishers to use areas. Systematic conservation planning has yet to be widely applied in marine systems, and the dynamics of spatial overlap of fishing with other activities have not been studied at scales relevant to fisher decision-making. This study demonstrates fisher decision-making is indeed affected by the real-time presence of other sectors in an area, and therefore trade-offs which need to be accounted for in marine planning. As marine resource extraction demands intensify, governments will need to take a more proactive approach to resolving these trade-offs, and studies such as this will be required as the evidential foundation for future seascape planning.},

But citizen-science projects vary in their ability to contribute usefully for science, conservation, or public policy. eBird has evolved from a basic citizen-science project into a collective enterprise, taking a novel approach to citizen science by developing cooperative partnerships among experts in a wide range of fields: population and distributions, conservation biologists, quantitative ecologists, statisticians, computer scientists, GIS and informatics specialists, application developers, and data administrators. The goal is to increase data quantity through participant recruitment and engagement, but also to quantify and control for data quality issues such as observer variability, imperfect detection of species, and both spatial and temporal bias in data collection. Advances at the interface among ecology, statistics, and computer science allow us to create new species distribution models that provide accurate estimates across broad spatial and temporal scales with extremely detailed resolution. eBird data are openly available and used by a broad spectrum of students, teachers, scientists, NGOs, government agencies, land managers, and policy makers. Feedback from this broad data use community helps identify development priorities. As a result, eBird has become a major source of biodiversity data, increasing our knowledge of the dynamics of species distributions, and having a direct impact on the conservation of birds and their habitats.},

	abstract = {Spatial biases are a common feature of presence–absence data from citizen scientists. Spatial thinning can mitigate errors in species distribution models (SDMs) that use these data. When detections or non-detections are rare, however, SDMs may suffer from class imbalance or low sample size of the minority (i.e. rarer) class. Poor predictions can result, the severity of which may vary by modelling technique. To explore the consequences of spatial bias and class imbalance in presence–absence data, we used eBird citizen science data for 102 bird species from the northeastern USA to compare spatial thinning, class balancing and majority-only thinning (i.e. retaining all samples of the minority class). We created SDMs using two parametric or semi-parametric techniques (generalized linear models and generalized additive models) and two machine learning techniques (random forest and boosted regression trees). We tested the predictive abilities of these SDMs using an independent and systematically collected reference dataset with a combination of discrimination (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve; true skill statistic; area under the precision-recall curve) and calibration (Brier score; Cohen's kappa) metrics. We found large variation in SDM performance depending on thinning and balancing decisions. Across all species, there was no single best approach, with the optimal choice of thinning and/or balancing depending on modelling technique, performance metric and the baseline sample prevalence of species in the data. Spatially thinning all the data was often a poor approach, especially for species with baseline sample prevalence {\textless}0.1. For most of these rare species, balancing classes improved model discrimination between presence and absence classes using machine learning techniques, but typically hindered model calibration. Baseline sample prevalence, sample size, modelling approach and the intended application of SDM output—whether discrimination or calibration—should guide decisions about how to thin or balance data, given the considerable influence of these methodological choices on SDM performance. For prognostic applications requiring good model calibration (vis-à-vis discrimination), the match between sample prevalence and true species prevalence may be the overriding feature and warrants further investigation.},

	abstract = {Building reliable species distribution models (SDMs) from presence-only information requires a good understanding of the spatial variation in the sampling effort. However, in most cases, the sampling effort is unknown, leading to biases in SDMs. This study proposes a method to jointly estimate the parameters of sampling effort and species densities to avoid such biases. The method is particularly suited to the analysis of massive but highly heterogeneous presence-only data. The proposed method is based on estimating the variation in sampling effort over units of a spatial mesh in parallel with the environmental density of multiple species using a marked Poisson process model. Based on simulations with realistic settings, we examined the performance and robustness of parameter estimations. We also analysed a large-scale citizen science dataset with highly heterogeneous sampling (Pl@ntNet), including around 300,000 occurrences of 150 plant species. We found that sampling effort was correctly estimated when the true sampling effort was constant within the cells of a spatial mesh. Estimation bias arose when sampling effort and environmental drivers strongly covaried within cells. Otherwise, the inference was correct and robust to sampling variation within cells. Running the model on real occurrences of 150 plant species provided an estimated map of relative sampling effort for 15\% of French territory. We also found that the density estimated for an exotic invasive plant was consistent with prior data. This is the first method jointly estimating species densities depending on environment, and sampling effort as an explicit spatial function, from occurrence data of multiple species. An asset of the method is that a few frequently observed species greatly contribute to correctly estimate sampling effort, thereby improving density estimation of all other species. This approach can thus provide reliable SDM for large opportunistic presence-only datasets, with broad spatial variation in sampling effort but also many species, such as datasets from citizen science programmes.},

	abstract = {We consider inference using multivariate data that are spatially misaligned; that is, involving variables (typically counts or rates) that are aggregated over differing sets of regional boundaries. Geographic information systems enable the simultaneous display of such datasets, but their current capabilities are essentially only descriptive, not inferential. We describe a hierarchical modeling approach that provides a natural solution to this problem through its ability to sensibly combine information from several sources of data and available prior information. Illustrating in the context of counts, allocation under nonnested regional grids is handled using conditionally independent Poisson-mullinomial models. Explanatory covariales and multilevel responses are also easily accommodated, with spatial correlation modeled using a conditionally autoregressive prior structure. Methods for dealing with missing values in spatial “edge zones” are also discussed. Like many recent hierarchical Bayesian applications, computing is implemented via a carefully tailored Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We illustrate our method with a complex dataset involving inhalation exposure to radon emanating from a depleted uranium fuel processing plant in southwestern Ohio. Structure counts (obtained from U.S. Geological Survey topographical maps) are used to realign sex- and age group-specific U.S. census block group population counts onto a 160-cell circular “windrose” centered at the plant.},

Unfortunately, only a certain class of latent Gaussian models are amenable to fitting with INLA. In this paper we describe Template Model Builder (TMB), an existing technique which is well-suited to fitting complex spatio-temporal models. TMB is relatively unknown to the spatial statistics community, but is a highly flexible random effects modeling tool which allows users to define complex random effects models through simple C++ templates. After contrasting the methodology behind TMB with INLA, we provide a large-scale simulation study assessing and comparing R-INLA and TMB for continuous spatial models, fitted via the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approximation. The results show that the predictive fields from both methods are comparable in most situations even though TMB estimates for fixed or random effects may have slightly larger bias than R-INLA. We also present a smaller discrete spatial simulation study, in which both approaches perform well. We conclude with an analysis of breast cancer incidence and mortality data using a joint model which cannot be fit with INLA.},
